```lrc
[00:10.83] Do or die, do or die
[00:14.04] I forgive, but I still remember
[00:17.11] Hold it down, human touch
[00:19.99] Fuck a check, fuck it up on the map
[00:24.19] If you hold me close, you can see the light
[00:27.21] I can see the city, they done lit a fire
[00:30.44] Lace me up, Hermès me up
[00:33.29] If they mess me up, I'll go Celsius
[00:36.41] I'm in the cut, True Religions
[00:39.44] What's it like being that high?
[00:42.65] What's it like being that crazy?
[00:45.61] Evil coast, waste it up
[00:48.52] Light it up, she can see the future
[00:51.28] And it's going up, they never show me love
[00:54.24] Give me loyalty, I say "Godspeed"
[00:57.34] I'm in the shadе, I'm still burning up
[00:59.86] Carried on my back and it's all in the legs
[01:04.08] And it's all in thе legs
[01:06.00] Keep it on my shoulder and I feel it every day
[01:11.92] Carried on my back and it's all in the legs
[01:16.04] And it's all in the legs
[01:17.72] They say the water's different, but it all tastes the same
[01:23.77] They say the water's different, but it all tastes the same
[01:29.67] They say the water's different, but it all tastes the same
[01:35.79] They say the water's different, but it all tastes the same
[01:41.70] They say the water's different, but it all tastes the same (The same)
